I am making this git repo for POC of how I can leversage the use of K8s in workplace

Inspired by: 
Nana Janashia

-----------------------------------------------------------
Demo Project ->
Simple setup of web application and database (MongoDB)

Components:

2 Deployment/Pod
2 Service
1 ConfigMap
1 Secret

We will create an internal service so that all components of that cluster can communicate amongst themselves

We need Database URL and credentials to connect and authenticate to DB

Config Map	Secret
----------	------
DB Url		DB Username
		DB Pwd

We will reference this inside the deployment file.

For hosting Mongo Express, we will be using external service to allow external requests to talk to the pod
URL: http://<IP Addrees of the node>:<Port of external service>

Secret lives in K8s and not inside the repository, so we won't give username and password for DB in the same config file

Secret Configuration File
-------------------------

- kind: 		"Secret"
- metadata/name:	a random name
- type:			"Opaque" - default for arbitrary key-value pairs
- data: 		the actual contents (in key value pairs) 

NOTE: Always run the secret.yml file before the deployment.yml file

Which database to connect?
MongoDB Address/Internal Service
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER

Which credentials to authenticate?
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD
